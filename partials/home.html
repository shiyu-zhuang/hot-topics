<h2>The Value of Money</h2> <img src="./img/money.jpg" alt="article-img">
<p>Money is a dependent variable that affects the many decisions people make in their lives, ranging from collegiate enrollment and job decisions to simple/major investments. Inadvertently or intentionally we make some of our biggest life decisions in accordance with money. But what makes money so fascinating? Perhaps it's the idea that these multi-colored bills and coins in our wallets allow us to set occupational goals for future successes or squander them. </p>
<br>
<p>There seems to be more to the face-value of a dollar bill than at first glance. Currency, money, wealth and sometimes power, are all words used to describe the same thing; a certain acquisition of financial stability to the point of security and comfort. Now money in its physical form is paper and coins, which have a higher representation as a standard of currency within a region. This definition highlights the conventions of money in an economical way. However, money on a more intimate level comes to represent something entirely different to mankind. </p>
<br>
<p>Happiness can't be bought, but show me a sad person buying a new Mercedes or BMW. The relationship between money and its owner is in how it's handled. Money can be a gateway toward happiness and financial safety, a grave into debt and IOUs, or a lock and safe for the more greed-driven. </p>
<br>
<p>The value of money changes in the hands of its possessor but not in a physical manner, but a metaphysical one. As an abstract value money is infinitely malleable, represented as a symbolic entity of power, greed, happiness, security, potential and status. As purchasing or buying becomes an infinite choice, very similarly wealth takes on an infinitely different meaning in the eyes of its beholder. The influence of money is a product of its owner and its use. </p>
<br>
<p>My personal relationship with money is a healthy one and it represents a potential future void of financial problems and insecurities. The pot-o-gold is the goal and I'll be damned if I let a leprechaun stop me from swimming in it. Not to be confused with greed, money has come to fuel my ambition as it does for most people who have financial goals. Unfortunately, many people try to exclude one major component of getting the big bucks; putting in the hard work. </p>
<br>
<p>Effort, and tons of it, is almost synonymous with the acquisition of money. No one ever said being rich was going to be easy. Consequently, money represents abstractly the grueling work and dedication towards a career choice or investment in life. It has the potential to satisfy the inner goals that self-efficacy creates for us. Flipping it on its head, money has the capacity to decimate lives with debt and poverty. We all want what is at the end of the rainbow. We're all in a race to see who can acquire the biggest pile faster than the next schmuck. But the satisfaction of working for your wealth is paramount in understanding the lessons of money. </p>
<br>
<p>Money simultaneously teaches humility and greed, patience and impulse, and stability and hopelessness. Dancing with money is to tango with the devil. More problems arise with the acquisition of money as its powerfully enticing forces snowball into a wrecking ball of mass enormity. </p>
<br>
<p>Understanding how to manage your time and money are quintessential in making sure you keep and obtain more of both. Moderation around the ideals of money-management can net the comfortable, financial result that all we entrepreneurs are looking for. Vacations on beaches, extravagant cars, you name it, if these are your “finish-lines” financially, then understanding the value of money will take you there. </p>
<br>
<p>Everyone has their own vision towards success. Money is not the end-all, be-all of life and happiness. Money curtails just as many failures as it does success, but how we handle and conduct ourselves with money produce the metaphysical meanings that money is to us individually and as a society. </p>
<br>
<p>Giving money produces just as much happiness as gaining it. Just as we all have personalities and make decisions, our personalities become reflected in how we manage our involvement with money. It can be a friend or enemy, but in a competitive world such as ours, you ought to become close friends with the “Jolly Green Giant”. </p>

    <h2 class="clearfix">GMO Food</h2>
    <p>GMO's — or genetically modified organisms — refer to the plants or animals created through the gene splicing techniques of biotechnology. In conversation, GMO's and GE foods refer to the same thing. They are foods created by merging DNA from different species.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The first GMO crop (the Flavr Savr tomato) was approved by the FDA in 1994. Since then, GE varieties of corn, soya, sugar beets and canola have become common local crops in Canada. In addition to locally produced crops, GE varieties of cottonseed oil, papaya, squash and milk products are imported from the USA into Canada. In a mere 20 years, GMO ingredients have made their way into most of the processed foods available on Canadian grocery shelves. Apples, potatoes and wheat are all in the lineup for approval.</p>
    <br>
    <p>GMO crops, when first introduced, were touted as the answer to world hunger. The argument was that by developing pesticide and herbicide resistant crops, farmer's would be able to increase their yields and decrease their costs. This has not proven to be the case. Instead, bugs and weeds have become increasingly resistant to the widespread applications of these chemicals, leading to increased use of both. More spraying means more costs for the farmers, more damage to the environment and more health concerns.</p>
    <br>
    <p>On the flips side, it means more product purchased from the seed producer. The companies that develop and patent GMO seeds are the same companies that develop and patent the pesticides and herbicides to which the unique seeds are resistant. Monsanto is the largest seed company in the world and owns about 86% of GMO seeds sown globally. It is also the parent of Roundup.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The safety of GMO foods is unproven and a growing body of research connects these foods with health concerns and environmental damage. For this reason, most developed nations have policies requiring mandatory labeling of GMO foods at the very least, and some have issued bans on GMO food production and imports.</p>
    <p>In Canada we do not.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Canadians are often unaware that the foods they choose contains GMO ingredients. It is this basic right to choice that is behind the growing movement to have GMO foods labeled. While environmental and food advocates lobby for labeling, other groups, like The Non-GMO Project, have created voluntary non-GMO certification to facilitate consumer information.</p>

    <h2>The View of World in 2100</h2>
    <br>
    <p>But if someone from 2100 could visit us now, how would we view them? Probably like the gods of mythology. They would command everything around them by wishing for it. They would have perfect and ageless bodies. And they would ride across the universe in magical chariots. In the past, we feared the gods of mythology. In the next 100 years, we will become them.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Based on interviews with 300 of the world’s top scientists, I’ve put together some predictions for what that world, 100 years in the future, will look like. This is not a work of science fiction, since prototypes of these inventions already exist, and all of them obey the laws of physics. Just a few of the predictions in my book “Physics of the Future” include: </p>
    <br>
    <p>1. The Internet will be in your contact lens. Imagine blinking, and then instantly going on line, accessing your home office, or home entertainment system anywhere or anytime. We will be able to download any movie, song, Web site, or piece of information off the Internet directly onto our Internet-enabled contact lenses. These lenses will also be able to identify people’s faces, translate their comments and provide subtitles, so that we will always know exactly with whom we are speaking and what they are saying in any language. We will live in a cross between “The Matrix” and real life. Tourists will love this, for example, since they will be able to see the glory of the Roman Empire resurrected in their contact lens as they walk among the ruins of Rome. Artists and architects will love it, as well, since they will be able to create great works of art by simply moving their hands in the air. People suffering from illnesses, like diabetes, will love it, too, because they will have immediate readouts of their heart rate, insulin levels, and other important conditions within their own bodies.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2. Computers will disappear, as will cellphones, clocks, watches, and MP3 players. Chips, costing less than a penny apiece, will be hidden by the millions in the environment. We will be able to command these hidden computers telepathically, directly via the mind. Computers will interpret the electrical signals emitted by our brains, decipher them, and carry out our wishes. When we walk into a room, we will be able to mentally control a computer that in turn will direct the many things around us. Moving heavy furniture, rearranging desks, and brewing a cup of coffee may be possible just by thinking about it. So we will be like the gods of mythology, mentally manipulating the world around us. We will also be able to conjure up almost any object just by wishing for it. This is done via “programmable matter,” which consists of millions of microscopic computer chips, which are intelligent and can be programmed to suddenly rearrange themselves into any shape or object on command, so that we will be able to create almost anything we can imagine (this is very similar to the Replicator from “Star Trek”).</p>
